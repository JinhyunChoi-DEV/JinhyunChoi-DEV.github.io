# **About Me**

Hello! My name is **{{ site.author.name }}**, a senior pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at DigiPen Institute of Technology. I am an enthusiastic senior software engineer, actively expanding my skills and experiences through various projects.

I am deeply committed to crafting clean, efficient, and bug-free code to enhance user experiences while strengthening code maintainability. With each project, I strive to adhere to SOLID principles and continually learn and apply various programming paradigms.

Particularly, my involvement in the Smash Legends project provided invaluable lessons in teamwork, collaboration, and the significance of effective communication within a large team. As a Client Game Programmer, I took pride in contributing to the release of the game in the actual gaming industry. Despite my role primarily focusing on client-side development, I gained valuable experience in utilizing numerous network systems for Outgame features.

Passionate about tackling technical challenges, I am dedicated to constant learning and growth. Keeping pace with the rapid evolution of technology, I actively pursue continuous learning to discover better solutions.

I am eager to seize opportunities to contribute to creating better solutions for the future. I look forward to meeting individuals who share the enthusiasm for growth and are ready to tackle future technological challenges together.
