## Description
- ###### Designed a physics-based character controller for in-game programming practice
- ###### Implemented various states and created a highly scalable and reusable codebase, building upon the movement base of an RPG game character
- ###### Achieved more realistic movement using an IK system

## Contributions
 - ###### Implemented a State Machine system using the Hierarchical State Machine pattern
 - ###### Structured the codebase to easily add various states to the State Machine
 - ###### Utilized the Floating Capsule Method to address issues with character IsGround detection and collisions with diverse geometries such as stairs and slopes
 - ###### Implemented more dynamic character animations using Root Motion & Blend Animation features
 - ###### Enabled procedural movement using an IK system, extending beyond basic animations
