# 3D Rendering Optimize

<br>
{% include elements/video.html id="2SOSclYiG1k" %}

## Description
- ###### Deal with the efficient representation and processing of complex 3D scenes in order to avoid bottlenecks in the use of the CPU and the GPU
- ###### Implemented a variety of spatial data structures: Binary Space-Partitioning Trees, Octrees, Kd-Trees, and Grid Data Structures
- ###### Implemented object-culling methods: Occlusion, Viewport, and Portal
- ###### Construction and uses of bounding volumes and their hierarchies for collision detection and related geometric operations


## Information

## Contributions
 - ###### Hybrid Rendering: Forward & Deferred Rendering(Shading)
 - ###### Simple Collision Intersection With Debug Drawing
 - ###### Bounding Volumes: Axis-Aligned Bounding Box(AABB), Bounding Sphere with Ritter's, Larsson's, and PCA-based Method
